# Geometric Operations and Other Mathematical Tools with Pillow
## Spatial operations use  pixels in a neighborhood to determine the present pixel value. Some applications include filtering and sharpening. They are used in many steps in computer vision, such as segmentation, and are a key building block in Artificial Intelligence algorithms.
- Linear Filtering
- Filtering Noise
- Gaussian Blur
- Image Sharpening
- Edges
